# LetsMoveIt--dockingstation
Description of the dockingstation of the project Let's Move It

## Getting started


##Prerequisites
First you need to put an ethernet cable between the PLC and your pc. Next you want to change your IP adress range to that from the PLC.
First open the network centrum

Click on ethernet.

Click on properties and on Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)

![IP-adres](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52155322/60008624-b0e9dd00-9674-11e9-8bcd-f725272b71de.JPG)

Change your IP-adres like in the picture above.
Now you will be able to communicate with the PLC from your pc so you can now open Lasal class 2. 

In Lasal click on the online settings

Change here the IP like in the picture or if you have troubles later by finding it click IP-scanner and search for the PLC. Note that the PLC needs about a minute after starting up to configure its own network and it cant be found before that.

Next click on the online button to go online.

Then open the file by clicking on file an on open project.

![open project](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52155322/60008629-b1827380-9674-11e9-9a39-3ecdf33607c5.png)

Select the .lcp file.

![program select](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52155322/60008630-b1827380-9674-11e9-88a7-cf76d819a801.JPG)

Most of the time the program opens correctly but sometimes you have to open the network seperately. This can be done by clicking on
network on the right side on the screen and click on Network0

![network choose](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52155322/60008625-b0e9dd00-9674-11e9-9c2d-1817f6809935.JPG)

If it works correctly you should see the next screen and you have opened the program and you are online.

Then you should be able to see the SFC scheme of the PLC.
